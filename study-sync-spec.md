# Feature Specification: StudySync Collaborative Study Planner

**Feature Branch**: `001-study-sync-planner`  
**Created**: 2026-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a project specification for StudySync, a collaborative study planner for university students that unifies group scheduling, course resources, and task progress tracking."

## Project Overview

### Description

StudySync is a collaborative study-planning platform for university students. It brings group scheduling, course-organized resources, and shared task progress into one workspace so students can decide when to study, find what they need, and see what remains to be done.

### Purpose

The product reduces coordination overhead across study groups by replacing disconnected calendars, chat threads, file folders, and personal task lists with linked course and group workflows.

### Target Audience

University students who study independently or in groups, including students coordinating recurring sessions across different schedules and courses. Group members are the primary users; a group owner or moderator manages membership and shared content.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Create an Account and Enter StudySync (Priority: P1)

As a university student, I want to sign up and create my profile so that I can join courses and study groups.

**Why this priority**: Every other workflow requires an identifiable user and a trusted boundary for shared academic content.

**Independent Test**: A new user can register with valid details, receives a usable signed-in session, and sees an empty personalized workspace without any other feature being enabled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unregistered student, **When** they submit a unique email, display name, and password that meet the stated rules, **Then** an account is created and the student is signed in.
2. **Given** an email already registered, **When** a student submits the sign-up form, **Then** no duplicate account is created and a clear correction message is shown.
3. **Given** invalid or incomplete details, **When** the student submits the form, **Then** field-level errors identify what must be corrected without storing the account.
4. **Given** a signed-in student with no courses or groups, **When** they open StudySync, **Then** they see an empty state with actions to create or join a course or group.

---

### User Story 2 - Set Up and Maintain a Course or Study Group (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to create, view, edit, and delete a course or study group so that shared work is organized around the right academic context.

**Why this priority**: Courses and groups are the organizing boundary for schedules, resources, and tasks.

**Independent Test**: An authenticated student can create a group, retrieve it, change its name or description, and delete it, with membership and authorization enforced at every step.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated student, **When** they provide a valid course or group name, **Then** the item is created and the creator becomes its owner.
2. **Given** a member, **When** they request a course or group they belong to, **Then** its details and member summary are returned.
3. **Given** an owner, **When** they change the name, description, or color label, **Then** later views show the updated values.
4. **Given** an owner, **When** they delete the item after confirming, **Then** it is no longer accessible and its dependent shared items are handled according to the stated retention policy.
5. **Given** a non-member or non-owner, **When** they attempt to read, update, or delete an item without permission, **Then** the request is rejected without revealing protected details.

---

### User Story 3 - Coordinate a Study Session with Availability and Voting (Priority: P1)

As a study-group member, I want to propose time slots, compare member availability, and vote so that the group can agree on a session time.

**Why this priority**: Scheduling is the primary collaborative value and should work before the resource and progress hubs are expanded.

**Independent Test**: A group with at least two members can create a session proposal, see overlap based on member availability, cast or change a vote, and finalize one slot.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a group member, **When** they create a session proposal with a title, duration, time zone, and candidate slots, **Then** the proposal is visible to eligible group members.
2. **Given** members have recorded availability, **When** a member opens the proposal, **Then** each candidate slot shows the overlap count and the participating members without exposing unavailable private details.
3. **Given** an open proposal, **When** a member selects a slot, **Then** their vote is recorded once and the aggregate count updates.
4. **Given** a member who has voted, **When** they select a different slot, **Then** their previous vote is replaced rather than duplicated.
5. **Given** the proposal owner, **When** they finalize a slot, **Then** the selected session appears on the shared calendar and later votes cannot change the result.
6. **Given** a proposal with no available overlap or no votes, **When** the owner tries to finalize it, **Then** finalization is blocked with a useful next action.

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### User Story 4 - Manage Course Resources and Files (Priority: P2)

As a course member, I want to create, read, update, and delete resource entries or uploaded files so that the group can find current study materials in one course hub.

**Why this priority**: Centralized materials make scheduled study sessions useful and reduce lost links and duplicate files.

**Independent Test**: A course member can add a resource with a title and location, find it in the course hub, edit its metadata, and remove it, while non-members are denied access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a course member, **When** they add a valid resource title and link or file, **Then** the resource is stored under exactly one course and appears in the course resource list.
2. **Given** a course member, **When** they open the resource list or request one resource, **Then** they see its title, type, creator, date, and current location.
3. **Given** the resource creator or an authorized moderator, **When** they update the title, description, tags, or location, **Then** the revised metadata is shown without creating a duplicate.
4. **Given** the resource creator or an authorized moderator, **When** they delete a resource, **Then** it is removed from future course listings and its references no longer resolve.
5. **Given** an unsupported or oversized file, **When** a member attempts to add it, **Then** the upload is rejected before it becomes visible and the limits are explained.

### User Story 5 - Track Tasks and Progress (Priority: P2)

As a student or group member, I want to create, read, update, and delete course tasks and mark progress so that everyone can see what is pending and what is complete.

**Why this priority**: Shared progress turns study plans into actionable work and gives groups a common view of readiness.

**Independent Test**: A member can create a task, view it in course and personal lists, edit its assignment or due date, change its progress, and delete it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a course member, **When** they create a task with a title, optional description, due date, and assignee, **Then** it appears in the course task list with an initial not-started state.
2. **Given** a member with access, **When** they filter tasks by status, assignee, or due-date range, **Then** only matching tasks are returned with stable counts.
3. **Given** a task editor, **When** they update its title, due date, assignee, or status, **Then** the change is visible in the course and personal views.
4. **Given** a task owner or authorized moderator, **When** they delete a task, **Then** it is removed from active task lists and no longer contributes to progress summaries.
5. **Given** a completed task, **When** a member reopens it, **Then** its state changes back to an active status and the progress summary recalculates.

### User Story 6 - Review a Unified Study Workspace (Priority: P3)

As a student, I want one course or group view showing upcoming sessions, resources, and task progress so that I can decide what to do next without switching tools.

**Why this priority**: This is the differentiating overview, but it depends on the P1 and P2 domain workflows.

**Independent Test**: With seeded schedule, resource, and task data, a member can open a course workspace and find the next session, resource counts, and progress summary with links to each detail view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a member with shared course data, **When** they open the workspace, **Then** upcoming finalized sessions, recent resources, and task progress are shown in their respective sections.
2. **Given** no data in one section, **When** the member opens the workspace, **Then** that section displays an actionable empty state without hiding populated sections.
3. **Given** data the member cannot access, **When** the workspace is loaded, **Then** private content is omitted rather than summarized or linked.

### Edge Cases

- A session proposal must handle members in different time zones and daylight-saving transitions using the proposal's declared time zone.
- Availability intervals that touch at an endpoint do not count as overlapping unless the requested duration fits fully inside both intervals.
- A group member who leaves or is removed must lose access to future shared content while historical ownership and audit information remain consistent.
- Concurrent edits to a vote, task, or resource must not silently overwrite a newer change; the user receives a retry or refresh outcome.
- Duplicate resource links and duplicate task submissions should be detected within the same course when the match is unambiguous.
- Expired, deleted, or inaccessible file locations must display a recoverable unavailable state rather than a broken download action.
- Empty lists, no-overlap results, overdue tasks, and failed uploads must each have an understandable message and next action.

### Implementation Priority

1. **P1 - Trust and coordination MVP**: Account creation, authorization, course/group CRUD, session proposal CRUD, availability overlap, vote replacement, finalization, and shared calendar display.
2. **P2 - Study execution**: Course resource/file CRUD, task CRUD, task statuses, assignees, due dates, filtering, and progress summaries.
3. **P3 - Unified experience**: Combined course workspace, richer search and filtering, notifications, recurring sessions, and additional collaboration refinements after core workflows are stable.

### Key Entities

- **Student**: A university user with identity, profile, and membership relationships.
- **Course**: An academic context that owns resources and tasks and may contain study groups.
- **Study Group**: A set of students collaborating within a course or across a defined study context.
- **Membership**: A student's role and access relationship to a course or group.
- **Availability**: A student's time interval and time-zone context used for overlap calculations.
- **Session Proposal**: A proposed study meeting with candidate slots, votes, status, and a finalized calendar event.
- **Candidate Slot**: A possible start and end time within a session proposal.
- **Vote**: A member's current choice of one candidate slot.
- **Resource**: A course-linked link, note, or file metadata record.
- **Task**: A course-linked unit of work with assignee, due date, status, and progress history.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: At least 90% of first-time students complete account creation and reach their workspace in under 2 minutes during usability testing.
- **SC-002**: At least 90% of tested groups can create a proposal, identify the best overlap, and finalize a slot in under 3 minutes when availability is present.
- **SC-003**: At least 95% of authorized requests for course, group, resource, and task data return a user-visible result within 2 seconds under the agreed pilot load.
- **SC-004**: At least 95% of unauthorized access attempts in acceptance testing are rejected without exposing protected course or group details.
- **SC-005**: At least 90% of test users can add or locate a course resource and create or update a task without assistance.
- **SC-006**: In a pilot, at least 80% of active study groups use the shared schedule and task progress views weekly during the first four weeks.
- **SC-007**: Every core CRUD story has automated acceptance coverage for success, validation failure, authorization failure, and empty or unavailable states before release.

## Assumptions

- Students use email and password registration for the first release; institutional single sign-on can be added later without changing the core domain stories.
- A course or group owner and authorized moderators may manage shared content; ordinary members may manage only content they own unless a story grants broader access.
- Files are subject to product-defined type and size limits and are referenced through a managed location; the exact limits are a planning decision, not a user-facing workflow change.
- Deleting a course or group uses a confirmation step and preserves minimal audit records while removing ordinary member access to active content.
- Notifications, recurring sessions, external calendar synchronization, grading, and formal university administration are outside the initial release.
